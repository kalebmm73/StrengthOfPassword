This project's purpose is to test the strength of a password of your choosing. 
When you run the program you will be prompted to enter a password into the textfield. 
Once you enter your password, you can click the "Calculate Strength" button which will tell you the category of safety your password falls into. 
The three options are "weak", "moderate", and "strong". You can also hide the password by clicking the check mark box.
